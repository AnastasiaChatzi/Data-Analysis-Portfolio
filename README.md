# Data Analysis Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in Data Analytics. I also share projects that I am working on during my journey in Data Analytics / Data Science. New projects will be constantly added!

## About

Hi, I'm Anastasia! I am a Linguist turned Data Analyst! I hold a bachelor's degree in Greek Linguistics, but I've always been keen on business-related topics, so I decided to pursue an MBA degree, where I majored in Marketing. Fascinated by the insights that Big Data Analytics can provide for today's businesses, I am currently enrolled on a Master's degree in Big Data, Marketing & Management, aspiring to dig deeper into data!
